# XFire Protocol Specification

# Iain McGinniss, 2007/08/16

* * *

This document aims to provide a full specification for the XFire instant messaging protocol. A lot of the information found in this document would not be available if it were not for the hard work of the xfirelib project team (http://xfirelib.sphene.net), who reverse engineered the protocol to write xfirelib. This information, along with some of my own findings from writing the [OpenFire](http://code.google.com/p/openfire) library and suite of tools, provide the basis for this document which aims to formally document what we discovered, and to be provided as a basis for implementing XFire communication libraries in alternative languages.

## High Level Details

The XFire protocol uses a mix of client/server communication and peer to peer communication. Client/server communication is carried out over a TCP/IP connection, with the client connecting to the XFire central server (cs.xfire.com) on port 25999. Peer to peer communication is performed using UDP datagrams, with the ports involved negotiated between the two peers.

As a rule, XFire uses little endian byte ordering and UTF-8 encoding for strings.

### Message Structure

The messages between client and server follow a common pattern:

|    0,1   |     2,3     |     4     |      5...     |
| :------: | :---------: | :-------: | :-----------: |
| MSG SIZE | MSG TYPE ID | NUM ATTRS | ATTRIBUTES... |

1.  The message size, as a 16-bit integer.
2.  The message type id. Each message type, from a login request to a chat message, has a unique 16-bit integer ID.
3.  The number of attributes within the message, as an 8-bit integer.
4.  The list of attributes for the message with their associated values.

Message attributes are formatted as follows:

|         0         |      1..n      |       n+1       |      n+2...     |
| :---------------: | :------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| ATTR NAME LEN (n) | ATTRIBUTE NAME | ATTR VALUE TYPE | ATTR VALUE DATA |

1.  The attribute name length, as an 8-bit integer.
2.  The attribute name, as an ISO/IEC 8859-1 encoded string (i.e. 8 bits per character).
3.  The attribute value.

The attribute value can be one of a set of predefined attribute types:

| Type ID | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x01    | A variable length string. The first two bytes of the data containa 16-bit integer indicating the length of the string, followed by the string data.                                                      |
| 0x02    | A 32-bit int.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 0x03    | A 128-bit session identifier, used to identify a particular user'ssession on the xfire network.                                                                                                          |
| 0x04    | A list. The first byte indicates the type of the items in the list,for instance 0x01 for a string list. The next two bytes indicate the number of items in the list, followed by each consecutive value. |
| 0x05    | A string keyed map. The first byte indicates the number of entries,followed by each entry, with a string name (prefixed by 8-bit string length) and type (the same format for messages as a whole).      |
| 0x06    | A DID value. As yet, the purpose of this value is unknown (See [DID Message](#did-message) for more information).                                                                                        |
| 0x09    | An integer keyed map (type 0x09). The first byte indicates the number of entries, followed by each entry, with an 8-bit integer key and type.                                                            |

An example of a simple message is the [client version message](#client-version-message), which has a single attribute named `version`. It looks like this (with each bytes value displayed in hexadecimal, or the character equivalent where appropriate):

| Position (hex)  |  00 |  01 |  02 |  03 |  04 |  05 |  06 |  07 |  08 |  09 |  0A |  0B |  0C |  0D |  0E |  0F |  10 |  11 |
| :-------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Value (hex)     |  12 |  00 |  03 |  00 |  01 |  07 |  76 |  65 |  72 |  73 |  69 |  6f |  6e |  02 |  43 |  00 |  00 |  00 |
| Value (literal) |     |     |     |     |     |     |  v  |  e  |  r  |  s  |  i  |  o  |  n  |     |     |     |     |     |

As you can see from the above, the message length is 18 (0x0012), the packet id is 3 (0x0003), there is a single attribute with name of length 7 (`version`), with a 32-bit value 0x00000043 (67 represented as a 32-bit int). Remember that because the protocol is little endian, the integers will appear with the least significant byte first, i.e. the message length will appear as 12 00 in the message.

### Connection Handshake

When initiating a new connection, the sequence of events is as follows:

1. The client opens a TCP/IP connection with the server, first sending the hexadecimal code 55 41 30 31 (or, as a string, `UA01`) as an opening statement.
2. The client then sends a [client information message](#client-information-message), followed by a [client version message](#client-version-message).
    1. If this version is older than the current XFire version, a [new version message](#new-version-available-message) will be sent and the server will send no more messages. The client should disconnect at this point.
3. The server will then send an [authentication challenge message](#login-challenge-message) to the client.
4. In response to this, the client will send a [login request message](#login-request-message), containing the user name and a SHA-1 hashed version of the password, combined with a salt string and constant for extra security.
5. The server will either respond with a [login success](#login-success-message) or [failure message](#login-failure-message).

Once a client has successfully logged in, the server will send a flurry of messages used to initialise the client (who the [user's friends are](#friend-list-message), [who is online](#session-id-list-message), and so on). Other messages follow a request / response model, where the client must send a message which triggers the server to send a matching response message (for instance, checking to see what friends of friends are online).

### Login Request Message

This message is sent by the client to the server in response to a [Login Challenge Message](#login-challenge-message) in order to authenticate the user. The server will respond with either a [Login Success Message](#login-success-message) or a [Login Failure Message](#login-failure-message).

### Chat Message

This message is sent by the client to the server, or directly to another user via UDP. The message can represent a number of things:

* An content message (e.g. `hi there`)
* An indication of whether the user is typing or not
* A list of the client's details (IP address, open UDP port, etc)
* An acknowledgement that a message from the peer was received

When chat messages are sent via the server, they will be received by the peer as a [Server Routed Chat Message](#server-routed-chat-message). 

If communication is to be routed via the XFire server, client information messages should be sent regularly to prevent high-latency warnings where the peer is a real XFire client. In OpenFire, these are sent with each real message, up to once every 5 seconds. It has not been determined what the threshold is for the XFire client to start reporting latency warnings.

| typing         | `32-bit int` | A boolean indicating whether the user is typing or not (`1` is typing, `0` is not typing). |

### Client Version Message

This message is sent by the client to the server immediately after a [client information message](#client-information-message) in order to report the version of the xfire client in use. This number changes frequently, incremented with each release of the XFire client (typically at least once a month). If the version number sent to the server is lower than the current released client, the server will send a [new version available](#new-version-available-message) message and cease communicating with the client (the TCP connection will remain open until the client closes it, but it will ignore any further messages from the client).

### Friends of Online Friend Request Message
